# Common Backend Project Structure

### `controllers/`
This directory holds the **controllers**, which are responsible for handling incoming requests, calling the appropriate services, and sending back responses. They act as the "entry point" for each request.

### `services/` or `business-logic/`
The **services** contain the core business logic of the application. They are called by the controllers and interact with the data layer (models/repositories). This separation ensures that the business logic is reusable and independent of the web framework.

### `models/` or `database/`
This directory defines the **data models** and how they interact with the database. It might contain ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) models or direct database access code.

### `routes/`
This directory defines the **API endpoints** and maps them to the corresponding controller functions. This keeps the routing configuration separate and organized.

### `config/`
Contains configuration files for the application, such as database connection settings, authentication details, and server port numbers.

### `middleware/`
Houses **middleware functions** that can process requests before they reach the controllers. Examples include authentication, logging, and error handling middleware.

### `utils/` or `helpers/`
A collection of reusable utility functions and helper classes that don't fit into the other categories. This can include functions for data validation, formatting, or custom error handling.

### Ktor Backend Project Best Practices

#### 1. Configuration Management
Store all environment-specific configurations (like database credentials, API keys, etc.) in a separate file (e.g., `application.conf` in Ktor). **Never hardcode sensitive information**. Use environment variables for production environments.

#### 2. Dependency Injection
Utilize a **dependency injection (DI)** framework (like Koin) to manage the dependencies between your components (controllers, services, repositories). This makes your code more modular, testable, and maintainable.

#### 3. Error Handling
Implement a **centralized error handling mechanism**. Use Ktor's `StatusPages` feature to catch exceptions globally and return consistent, well-structured error responses (e.g., JSON objects with an error message and status code).

#### 4. Asynchronous Programming
Leverage Ktor's support for **Kotlin coroutines** for non-blocking I/O operations. This allows your application to handle many requests concurrently without creating a thread for each one, improving performance and resource utilization.

#### 5. Testing
Write **unit tests** for your business logic (services) and **integration tests** for your API endpoints (controllers and routes). Ktor provides a testing framework that makes it easy to test your application's routes and request handlers.

#### 6. Structured Logging
Use a logging framework (like SLF4J with Logback) and follow a **structured logging** approach. Log meaningful events with context (e.g., user ID, request ID) to make it easier to debug issues and monitor your application in production.

### File Creation Standards and Programming Rules

#### File Naming Conventions
* **Use descriptive and consistent naming:** File names should clearly indicate their purpose. For example, a controller for user-related operations should be named `UserController.kt`.
* **Follow PascalCase for classes and files:** Kotlin best practices suggest using PascalCase for class names, and by extension, for the files that contain them (e.g., `UserService.kt`).

#### Code Structure and Style
* **Use a consistent code formatter:** Tools like ktlint can automatically enforce a standard style, ensuring all team members write code that looks the same.
* **Keep files concise:** Avoid creating "god files" that contain a large number of unrelated classes or functions. Each file should ideally have a single responsibility.
* **Use private modifiers:** Limit the visibility of classes and functions to the smallest possible scope. This helps encapsulate logic and reduce unintended side effects.

#### Programming Principles
* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class, function, or module should have one, and only one, reason to change. For example, a service should only contain business logic, not handle HTTP requests or database queries.
* **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code. If you find yourself writing the same logic in multiple places, extract it into a reusable function or class.
* **Fail-fast approach:** Validate input at the earliest possible stage. This helps prevent bugs by catching invalid data before it can cause problems deeper in the application.
* **Favor immutability:** Use immutable data classes (`data class`) whenever possible. This reduces the risk of unexpected state changes and makes the code easier to reason about, especially in a concurrent environment.
